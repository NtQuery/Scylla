Scylla - x64/x86 Imports Reconstruction
=======================================

ImpREC, CHimpREC, Imports Fixer... this are all great tools to rebuild an import table, 
but they all have some major disadvantages, so I decided to create my own tool for this job.

Scylla's key benefits are:

 - x64 and x86 support
 - full unicode support
 - written in C/C++
 - plugin support
 - works great with Windows 7

This tool was designed to be used with Windows 7 x64, so it is recommend to use this operating system. 
But it may work with XP and Vista, too.

Building
--------

  Prerequisite:
  * Visual Studio 2017 or newer
  * Windows Desktop Development components
  * Windows SDK version 8.1+
  * Git for Windows

Clone this repo and open up your `Developer Command Prompt for VS` to the code folder.

```shell
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> msbuild Scylla
```

Known Bugs
----------

### Windows 7 x64

Sometimes the API kernel32.dll GetProcAddress cannot be resolved, because the IAT has an entry from apphelp.dll
Solution? I don't know

### Only Windows XP x64:

Windows XP x64 has some API bugs. 100% correct imports reconstruction is impossible.
If you still want to use XP x64, here are some hints:

* EncodePointer/DecodePointer exported by kernel32.dll have both the same VA.
  Scylla, CHimpREC and other tools cannot know which API is correct. You need to fix this manually.
  Your fixed dump will probably run fine on XP but crash on Vista/7.

### ImpREC plugin support:

Some ImpREC Plugins don't work with Windows Vista/7 because they don't "return 1" in the DllMain function.
